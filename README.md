## ‚ú® Overview
This project simulates the gravitational interaction of stars using the **Barnes-Hut algorithm**, a spatial partitioning technique that approximates N-bodies efficiently. 

Each partical in the system move under the influence of others' gravititional forces. Instead of computing all pairwise interaction, we use **quadtree** to approximate clusters as single bodies, reducing the complexity to roughly O(nlogn).

## üß© Algorithm
### 1. Barnes‚ÄìHut Principle
The Barnes‚ÄìHut Principle recursively divides the 2D simulation space into quadrants, forming a quadtree:
* Each **leaf node** represents one body.
* Each **internal node** represents the `center of mass` and `total mass` of all bodies within that quadrants.

When computing the force on a body, if a node if far enough, it treats that entire region as a single body instead of calculating individual forces.

### 2. Building the Quadtree
To construct the quadtree, we recursively subdivide the 2D space into four equal-sized regions until each region contains at most **one body**.

#### Steps:
1. **Define simulation boundary**  
   Start with a square region that encloses all bodies.

2. **Insert each body**  
   For each body:
   - If the node is empty ‚Üí store the body there.  
   - If the node already contains one body ‚Üí  
     subdivide the node into **four child quadrants**:  
     - Northwest (NW)  
     - Northeast (NE)  
     - Southwest (SW)  
     - Southeast (SE)  
     Then, reinsert both the existing and the new body into the appropriate child according their position.

3. **Aggregate mass information**  
   After all bodies are inserted, each internal node computes:
   - M = sum of all masses in the quadrant
   - r_cm = (1 / M) * sum(m_i * r_i) for all i in the quadrant
    where `M` is the total mass and `r_cm` is the **center of mass** of that quadrant.

This process yields a tree where upper levels represent clusters of bodies and lower levels represent individual bodies.

  <em>Figure: Supossing that we are adding C to the quadtree. (Left) B and C occupy the same quadrant, so the space is subdivided into four equally sized subquadrants. (Right) In the quadtree structure, we divide the node previously pointing to B into four leaves based on the four subquadrants, and assign B to the ‚ÄúNW‚Äù subquadrant and C to the ‚ÄúSW‚Äù subquadrant.</em>

### 3. Gravitational Force Computation
The forces between two bodies/clusters is calculated by Newton's law:

F_ij = G * (m_i * m_j) / r_ij^2 * r_hat_ij

where:
- `G` is the gravitational constant,  
- `r_ij` is the distance between the two bodies/clusters,  
- `r_hat_ij` is the unit vector from i to j.

When applying the Barnes‚ÄìHut approximation, we only use the center of mass of a node if:

s / d < theta

where:
- `s` = width of the region,  
- `d` = distance from the body to the region‚Äôs center of mass,  
- `theta` = opening angle threshold.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation Dynamics
Each time step consists of:
1. **Building the Quadtree** ‚Äî recursively partitioning the space based on ball positions.  
2. **Computing Forces** ‚Äî traversing the quadtree to accumulate gravitational forces.  
3. **Updating Positions and Velocities** ‚Äî using simple Euler integration
